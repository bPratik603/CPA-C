//  Local data definition statement without keyword static 

//  Storage strategy: Allocated newly per function call.
//  Time of allocation: time of function 
//  Time of de-allocation (freeing): return of function 
//  Storage place: stack frame of the function created in 
//  stack section in response to function call

//  Because it is allocated per call and freed at the end of the 
//  call, it cannot retain value across two successive calls 


//  Re-entrant function: 
//      A function is re-entrant if its  another instance 
//      may be spawned while its one instance is already 
//      going on. 

//  
//  Re-entrant functions appear in three scenarios 
//  1) Recursion 
//  2) Multithreading (Reentracy of kind 1)
//  3) Interrupt handling (asynchronous calls) (Reentrancy of kind 2)
